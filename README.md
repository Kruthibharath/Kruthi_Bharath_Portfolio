# Interactive Personal Portfolio Built with Next-Gen Web Tech

My personal portfolio website, built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, offers a dynamic and responsive platform to explore my skills and experience. Featuring interactive elements, data visualizations, and a mobile-friendly design, it showcases my passion for clean code and modern web development. Through this project, I honed my skills in building performant and accessible user interfaces. I invite you to explore the code on GitHub and consider this website a testament to my ability to deliver innovative solutions.

## Tech Stack used:

React: modern framework for dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
Vite: lightning-fast development server and bundler.
TypeScript: improved type safety and code stability.
Tailwind CSS: build responsive and customizable interfaces.

## Project Structure

## Creating myPortfolio React Application:

There are different ways to create a React application. I have choosen the best 2 ways of creating it:

1️⃣ `Create React App` - CRA is what we've been using so far in the programme to make our React apps.

```
npx create-react-app@latest ./client --template typescript
```

2️⃣ `Vite` - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a popular alternative to Create React App, with faster build times and more flexibility than create-react-app.

### The Vite way:

1.npm install -g create-vite / npm create vite@latest

1. npm create-vite@latest my-portfolio -- --template react-ts
   cd my-portfolio
